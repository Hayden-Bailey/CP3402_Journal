Content Insights
This week I was able to re-use my previous group work experiences to participate
in our assignment group's first meeting. With this meeting we were able to come together
and set up all of the necessary tools we will be using for assignment interaction.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
From a situation like our groups first meeting which may have been daunting or possibly
disastrous, by using previous group-work experiences I was able to help do my part to
help ensure that all of the required tool set up and required jobs flowed smoothly and 
interactions were at a positive.
