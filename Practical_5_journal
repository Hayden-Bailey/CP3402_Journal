Content Insights
This week I learnt the functionality possibilities that arise when you are able to implement child themes
into a WordPress website. It is easy to see that by utilising child themes you are able to make smaller
changes to the website much easier than it would have been by changing in the parent style.css file. 

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Initially the requirement of creating the new folder within the Wordpress website file location
was daunting to me and I wasn't so sure where to locate this file. However with the previous learning
done on the WordPress website creation I was able to use hands-on approaches to isolate the necessary file
locations which needed to be interacted with. In learning the required code in the functions.php file was
also a good refresher into the PHP learnt within the first year Web Design subject.
