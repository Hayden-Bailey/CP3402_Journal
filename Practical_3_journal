Content Insights
This week I learnt that the Wordpress CMS in terms of design seems to have a far more 
user-friendly layout in comparison with Joomla. It also seems to be easier when initially
creating a website to work on.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
By working through guides and videos I was able to get a Wordpress website up and running
even if it was one of the design templates which was provided through the CMS. This gave
me decent knowledge for uploading other articles to the website when they are ready.
