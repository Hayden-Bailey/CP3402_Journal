Content Insights
This week I was not able to put in the hours required to learn about local development &
deployment using Vagrant for the subject and therefore was not able to complete the practical.
I will be attempting my hardest to catch up with this effort this week.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
There are no learning insights I was able to gather this week due to lack of work being put
into the subject on my part.  I will be striving to make this week better.
