Practical 2 Journal

Coming into week 3 of this semester I put the first 2 weeks of this subject behind the others that I had assuming that I would be able to easily 
keep up with the content. When I began looking over what was required in the practicals and individual learning I began to see that this time 
had actually put me quite far behind where I should be.

At the start I had a lot of issues grasping where to start as I initially believed that the whole website HTML was required to be written from scratch. 
On reading Slack comments I have now found that templates are able to be used, which swerved me into learning the Joomla CMS before progressing further with
creating the website.

Even though this learning is reversed to the steps that the practicals have outlined so far, in spending the time understanding the Joomla CMS I have
been better able to get a grasp on the direction the subject requires.
