Content Insights
On utilising Sass more and more I was able to see how simple it was to integrate
the language into a project to create a simple and clean CSS workflow. In utilising
a Sass compiler extension within VS Code it becomes even moreso helpful with the
automatic updating and correspondence of multiple files.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
In beginning to learn Sass I was unable to fully understand how it linked in with
a project's workflow. What got me through this however was getting down to a more
hands-on approach and once I was able to start writing some code in the language
it started to make more sense.
